# epicast-julia-tools
A collection of Julia packages for wrangeling data related to the [EpiCast](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03604) epidemic simulator.

## Sub-modules

### EpicastTables

Basic table-like data structure for storing `time x location x variable` count data as well as 1d and 2d variants. 

### Epicast

Basic I/O and preprocessing routines for data in either count or event format.

### EpicastPlot

Basic plotting of timeseries data.

### PlotHelpers

Basic plotting helper function that are occationally useful. Function provided herein are not specific to Epicast or used by other modules in this repository, but are useful for constructing more complex figures such as those appearing in recent Epicast-related publications.

### EpicastGeoplot

More feature-rich plotting of timeseries and geographic (i.e., map) data.

## Example usage
```julia
using Epicast, EpicastGeoplot; const EG = EpicastGeoplot

ifile = "<path_to_a_count_or_event_file>"

# name of the column to preprocess (we're only going to do one here)
col_name = "total"

# gist: load data, aggregate to County level, apply 7-day moving average
# convert to new counts per day, normalize counts by resident population of each
# county / 100k
data = EG.geoplot_data(
    Epicast.preprocess!(
        # aggregate count data at the county level
        Epicast.aggregate(County, Epicast.read_rundata(ifile)),
        col_name,
        smooth=true, # apply 7-day moving average
        diff=true,   # convert cumulative counts to "new per day"

        # function to "get denominator" for normalizing data
        # x is an Epicast.Rundata object, var is a column name
        get_denom = (x,var) -> Epicast.demographics(x, var) .* 1e-5
    )
)

# make sure the units given by the y-label reflect the normalization performed
# above
EG.make_figure(data, "total", ylab="New cases per 100k residents")

# or to save the animation to an mp4 iff ffmpeg is on the PATH:
# EG.make_figure(data, "total", ofile = "./test.mp4")

```
